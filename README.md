# SQLAlchemy Challenge

This project focuses on a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii. Utilizing Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I conducted a detailed climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. The analysis includes precipitation and station analyses to uncover weather trends that might affect a holiday vacation in Honolulu. Furthermore, I designed a Flask API to serve the results of my analyses, making the data accessible through various endpoints.
